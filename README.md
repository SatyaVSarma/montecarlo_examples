# Examples of Monte-Carlo applications

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook presenting a few applications of Monte-Carlo techniques :

- Computing a probabilty via Monte-Carlo integration
- Finding the maximum of a sinusoidal function via stochastic gradient descent
- Simulating a whole distribution using the random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

The slides of the presentation I gave are also available in this repository. The examples of the notebook correspond to slides 11, 16 and 24.
